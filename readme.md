### Motivations (Why an own crate?)

This library originated from two primary motivations:

- Firstly, as we learn Rust programming language, we sought a practical project to enhance our skills in creating
  reusable public crates.
- Secondly, this functionality is a core requirement for our project, **Rusty**.

Recognizing its potential utility beyond our immediate needs, we decided **to develop and share it as a public crate for
everyone to use**.
